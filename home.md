## Overview {#overview}

COVID-19 pandemic and government restriction have rapidly transformed people’s daily social activities into the new form of online society. For many people with disabilities, options like promoting remote working, online education, and online shopping have been needed for years. So what are the gaps in digital accessibility for those people with disabilities to access the Social Web resources? Moreover, in an online world blighted by barriers for those with physical, sensory and cognitive difficulties, what could be done with the power of AI technologies?

With the rapidly transformation of the social actives from offline to online since the pandemic, many people with disabilities have encountered both opportunities and challenges in their daily social life. The power of AI technologies, such as natural language processing, speech recognition and text translation, computer vision and deep learning has been used in many ways to provide support for disabled people including the provision of alternative forms of communication, innovative mobility aids and improvements in way finding.

This workshop aims to invite both academic and industry experts in the area of digital accessibility providing their research and views as to a range of issues they perceive as causing barriers for those with disabilities during or after the pandemic. AI experts will also be invited to contribute the research of possible solutions or strategies that could be used to plug the gaps in accessibility. The goal of this workshop includes:

- Understand how the pandemic has changed the social life for people with disabilities on the Web
- Discuss the accessibility gaps and barriers
- How AI could enable the field of Social Web to be more accessible and inclusive.

## Call for Papers (CfPs) {#CfPs}

In this workshop, we especially welcome contributions that:

- Have a broader perspective on the Web Sciecne and AI that could better improve inclusive social life for people with disabilities (i.e., online and offline)
- Present successful cases of interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary AI and Inclusion research
- Examine automation and AI in all its manifestations relevant to the Web and AI Inclusion
- Consider the impact of COVID on technology adoption, risk perception and risk taking, change management, digital health, remote working and remote learning for people with disabilities.

#### Important Dates

- April 23, 2021 - Workshop paper submission deadline
- April 30, 2021 - Notification
- May 10, 2021 - Camera-ready versions due
- June 21-22, 2021 - Workshops and Tutorials.

_\*All submission deadlines are midnight in the Anywhere on Earth (AoE) time zone._

#### Format of the Submissions

Please upload your submissions via TBC

The AI and Inclusion workshop, co-event with ACM Web Science Conference will run as an online conference, where authors will present their work remotely to online participants. There is one type of submission: All contributors will submit an abstract (max 400 words) followed by a full paper.

The authors shall adopt the current [ACM SIG Conference proceedings template](https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/word-template-workflow) (acmart.cls).

Please submit papers as Accessible PDF files using the ACM Submission template (single column). To create your PDF submission, you may use either Microsoft Word format or the ACM LaTeX template on Overleaf (ACM Conference Proceedings “Master” Template) using the “manuscript” option. A full description of the procedure can be found in this [link](https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/word-template-workflow). For the review process, manuscripts should be of approx. 9-13 pages length single column (inclusive of references, appendices, etc.).

Please note that accepted papers will later be re-formatted with the sigconf style (double column) at camera-ready time. When changing to this style manuscripts may also need to be adjusted to the corresponding final page limit of between 6 and 10 pages (inclusive of references, appendices, etc.).

All contributions will be judged by the Program Committee upon rigorous peer review standards for quality and fit to the conference, by at least three referees. We will adopt a single-blind review process. Do not anonymise your submissions. Submissions without authorship information will be desk-rejected without review.

For authors who wish to opt-out of publication proceedings, this option will be made available upon acceptance. This will encourage the participation of researchers from the social sciences that prefer to publish their work as journal articles. All authors of accepted papers (including those who opt out of proceedings) are expected to present their work (virtually) at the conference. In 2020, the Web Science conference registration costs were kept low, and the intention is to continue this for Web Science 2021.

## Schedule {#schedule}

The workshop is scheduled within half day either on 21 June or 22 June, 2020. The schedule includes:

- Welcome (15 mins)

_The panel session will include invited experts in the field of digital accessibility and AI technologies. Each member of digital accessibility experts will pose accessibility gaps or barriers faced by those people with disabilities during or after pandemic and each member of AI experts will discuss the possible solutions or strategies that can overcome these gaps with leveraging the power of AI technologies._
